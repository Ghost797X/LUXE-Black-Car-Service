This directory is intended to hold image files for the website. Since it is a directory and not a file, it will be left intentionally blank. 

src/images is where you would place your high-resolution images, such as the background video or image slider of the Cadillac Escalade, images of the interior, and any other visuals that align with the luxury theme of the service.
